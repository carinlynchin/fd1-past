<div class=description>FD Productions was exclusively hired by the American Chemical Society, Alon Gorodetsky and his team from the University of California Irvine to present their findings at the American Chemical Society National Meeting in Denver. <br><br>Video Description: Squid are the ultimate camouflage artists, blending almost flawlessly with their backgrounds so that unsuspecting prey can’t detect them. Using a protein that’s key to this process, scientists have designed “invisibility stickers” that could one day help soldiers disguise themselves, even when sought by enemies with tough-to-fool infrared cameras. Alon Gorodetsky and his team from the University of California Irvine will present their findings at the American Chemical Society National Meeting in Denver.
